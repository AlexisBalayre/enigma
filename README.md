# Enigma

## Concept of Secret NFTs:
Imagine each NFT as a book. The public side is the cover that everyone sees, but the private content, the pages within, remain exclusive just for you. Imagine the hype that could be generated by collections of secret NFTs, where only the buyers would know the contents: art, photo, video, gif, music, pdf, personal data, …


A public URI, visible in plain text to everyone.
Here is an example of public URI (used for OpenSea for example): 
```
{ 
"description": "", 
"external_url": "”, 
"image": ”", 
"name": "", 
"author": "l", 
}
```

A private URI, accessible to everyone but encrypted.
Here is an example of private URI: 
```
{ 
"pseudo": "", 
"email": "", 
"discord": "", 
"twitter": "", 
"referral_code": "", 
"country": "", 
"language": "", 
"wallet_address": "", 
"preferred_currency": "", 
"preferred_theme": "", 
"preferred_language": "", 
"preferred_chain": "", 
"accept_cookies": false, 
"profile_picture": "", 
"beneficiaries": [ 
{ 
"wallet_address": "", 
"wallet_public_key": "", 
} 
] 
}
```
## Some Use Cases 
### Exclusive Digital Collectibles:
Digital art and collectibles have taken the world by storm. Imagine an NFT where the public URI showcases a beautifully rendered artwork, while the private URI unlocks hidden layers, animations, or artist commentaries, accessible only to the owner. Such exclusivity not only adds layers of depth and interaction to the artwork but also elevates its value and appeal in the collector's world. 

### Access Control to Events & Content:
Secret NFTs can redefine exclusivity. Envision an NFT serving as a concert ticket: the public URI validates the ticket ownership, displaying basic event details. Meanwhile, the private URI could hide surprises: backstage passes, VIP access, or even special virtual links for online events. This layered approach provides a unique experience for attendees and can be adapted for webinars, exclusive online content, or members-only virtual gatherings. 

### Intellectual Property Protection:
For creatives, protecting intellectual property is crucial. Secret NFTs offer a novel solution. The public URI can display the creation or invention's title, providing recognition. Simultaneously, the private URI can encrypt early drafts, original sketches, or prototype details, ensuring that the creative journey remains confidential and protected. This safeguards the creator's rights while allowing them to showcase their achievements.

### Personal Data Vaults:
In a data-driven world, privacy is a pressing concern. Secret NFTs can serve as personal data vaults. While the public URI acts as a generic label, perhaps indicating "Personal Vault", the private URI can store encrypted personal data—preferences, diaries, or even crucial documents. Users get a decentralized, secure space, ensuring that their sensitive data remains under their control and accessible only to them.

## Summary
A DApp that lets someone encrypt a file (art, photo, video, gif, music, pdf, personal data, ..) and store it in a secret NFT. It would then be possible to transfer this NFT to anyone, and only that person would be able to decrypt the private content and view it. All in a secure, user-friendly (both for web2 and web3 users) and decentralised way. The idea, of course, is to include as many solutions as possible from the event's sponsors (for prizes).
